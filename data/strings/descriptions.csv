# FROST,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_frost,SHIP,"A baseline model of Wanzer optimized for mission versatility and a light logistical load. This is the cheapest series of Wanzers still in service, but the chassis has solid characteristics all around, and a few updates to the design when needed have maintained its efficiency over the cycles.

The Frost is a 6th generation Wanzer but is only two generations into the space-oriented version of the Wanzer concept. The relative immaturity of the platform and its kinks have been ironed out over time, but the avionic controls are less than ideal for the extreme requirements of high-speed long-range space combat. As such the design had to be equipped with close-quarter weaponry to maximize the chances of a lethal hit: In this instance a Covet smooth-bore revolver that fires tungsten carbide flechettes accompanied by a tungsten coated, chemically sharpened monofilament combat blade. While limited in range, this line of Wanzers is still capable of handily carrying out their mission in the modern battlefield, and is not to be underestimated by standard fighter pilots.",,,

# STRIFE,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_strife,SHIP,"""An upgraded 6th generation Wanzer chassis, additional armor plating and redundant backup systems ensure this craft will keep its place to the top of the food chain. A versatile high damage Fragmentation load-out complemented by an integrated point defense system give this model a deadly reputation throughout the Sector. However it is somewhat lacking raw firepower when facing particularly armored targets.

With an additional Sub-reactor Combo Fuel pack attached to the rear of the Strife, much-needed power is fed into the pulse drives to maintain a favorable acceleration curve despite the weight of the extra applique gigajoule electro-armor. Still, the extensive model upgrades made the chassis somewhat unwieldy for interception roles, but the tradeoff is that even a single wing is more than capable of taking apart an isolated frigate.""",,,

# HOAR,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_hoar,SHIP,"The Hoar chassis is a late 6th generation Wanzer that benefited from a mature technological platform. As such it is a well-rounded and efficient design specifically tailored to work in tandem with larger ships. Their two AFP-99 ""Tombstone"" high-velocity guns are efficient at dispatching strike-crafts and missiles alike thanks to their exceptional accuracy, and they can quickly finish off ships previously damaged by heavy fire. The head-mounted compact Winee provides an intermittent ability to neuter a whole strike craft formation at once.

The development process of the Hoar-type chassis is still used today in master-classes on project management. The craft was produced on time, within budget, respected the design specifications, and incurred only a tiny number of casualties during testing. Hoars have since seen multiple updates to keep them relevant in the ever-evolving combat space, including improved engines, lighter and more efficient armor, and better weapons. The use of a relatively large crew also offered interesting benefits when it came to multi-tasking and fine manipulations. As such, Hoars are often deployed to help with search-and-rescue operations after a battle. Their sturdy construction and two prehension devices being quite handy for such tasks.

However, at some point the chassis was still reaching its limits and was about to be limited to back-line escort duties when the Diable Avionics Design Board decided to use this well-known type of strike-craft to test their prototype Quantum Targeting Prediction computers(TM). The somewhat rudimentary (compared to later version of both the computer and the software) targeting override revealed a depth of untapped potential: for a brief moment the test-Wanzer was able to accurately engage as many targets as the operators could feed the system with, and once coupled with a temporary shunt of all operational safeties, it could destroy most of them in that time-frame. Sadly the system cannot be kept online for long as the computer has to be maintained a few thousandths of a degree above absolute zero. On the other hand, the crews would not be able to survive its operation much longer either, especially when their Wanzer is nearly disassembling itself around them.",,,

# WARLUST,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_warlust,SHIP,"Slow but having quite a long reach, these Wanzers carry a highly damaging sniper weapon, a Magicbox anti-missile launcher, built-in PD on the turreted sensory package and two small drones companions. This load-out allows them to dispatch lightweight targets quickly while maintaining a 360 degrees defense coverage, making them a superb escort strike-craft.

The gold standard for defense Wanzers, a perfect balance of effectiveness at a still reasonable price tag. The Warlust chassis is for all intents and purposes an autonomous fully-featured point-defense solution. Built using a standardized connection system called MULS-P ""Multi-Unit Linkage System - Production"", this interchangeable system allows two differing series of 7th generation Wanzers parts to be matched together into a working unit, weapon calibration notwithstanding. Damaged parts can be swapped out and put aside to be repaired out of combat, reducing the workload for the rearming carrier craft.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# AVALANCHE,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_avalanche,SHIP,"The 7th gen ""Avalanche"" MBW is a monster in wolf's clothing. Heavily armored, armed with a twin shots Snub-Recson and its signature D64-FLAK ""Snow Ball"" scatter-cannon, the Avalanche is already a very dangerous machine on paper. The fact that engineers built-in enough safe mechanical margins to sustain a few seconds of extreme performance overdrive is just the cherry on top of an already impressive cake.

Fairly mobile for its size, the Avalanche is the Jack-of-all-trades of the 7th generation. Especially deadly to strike-crafts and frigates, it can tangle with heavier foes when properly supported. They are also the largest Wanzer model equipped with two Haptic AppropriatioN Devices making them uniquely suited for operation requiring fine manipulations and/or recovery. Crew mess tales recant the exploits of black-ops Avalanche pilots pulling off ""impossible"" sabotage operations, planting bombs on stations undetected long before they would be used, or snatching some enemy officer in their transfer shuttle right out of the sky.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# BLIZZAIA,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_blizzaia,SHIP,"The perfect complement to a few wings of Avalanches or Warlusts, the Blizzaia brings the much needed heavy firepower required to break the strongest warships in the Sector. Their low speed makes them quite vulnerable, so providing a light escort is recommended to ensure they survive long enough to deliver their full payload.

A bomber equivalent sporting a D13-4 ""Cicada"" grenade launcher and a Grave Light Auto-Cannon. Early models had teething issues regarding the grenades detonation timer, leading to several instances of friendly fire. Having unpowered and hard to track explosive devices floating around the enemy in a busy battlefield may sound like a good idea at first, but having your own fleet forced to fly through them will change that line of thinking.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# ZEPHYR,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_zephyr,SHIP,"An early 9th gen model of Wanzer that later lead to both the Valiant-class and the Raven-class Wanzers. For the former, it demonstrated the validity of the concept of multiple energy configurations via physical component reconfiguration, aka Versatile Frame Design. For the latter, it proved that larger models of Wanzers were able to stand toe to toe with frigates, survive such encounter while still being serviceable by a modified Wanzer gantry (those now being the standard on all Diable Avionics ship models with Wanzer carrying capacity). 

Despite having been designed to use traditional controls, this Wanzer also served as a test-bed for the vastly more efficient S-Type Neural Interface. Today's modernized retrofits are now using those by default and will only accept manual inputs after some minor cockpit modifications. Given the constant shortage of well trained S-type pilots, about 67% of the Zephyrs undergo the procedure immediately after exiting the production line, a fact often pointed out as a waste of resources by the administration.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# VALIANT,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_valiant,SHIP,"The (current) pinnacle of strike-craft Wanzer technology, the Valiant received its ""Versatile"" designation from the ability to reconfigure its thruster profile for maximum velocity or maneuverability. This makes them the fastest Wanzers on the battlefield, alleviating the key weakness of the other models. In addition to speed, Valiant Wanzers are also equipped with a shield, a pair of Micro-Missile launchers, a PD turret and a pair of deadly miniaturized electromagnetic rifles. This well-rounded load-out allows them to effectively engage any target. Unsurprisingly, they come with a price tag matching their impressive performance.

Although the use of transforming Wanzers remains unreliable, their performance is not to be understated. The Valiant is a 9th+ generation Wanzer, incorporating expensive miniaturized TX-5 omni-shield technology and advanced energy weapons. Additionally, this Wanzer was designed to be able to reconfigure its hull components and internal machinery to maximize energy flow to its engines when required.

Due to the multiple control modes needed to operate the Valiant, most pilots get a surgically implanted neural-link interface called the S-Type device, which maps out neuron activity patterns for control inputs. Out of ten trained pilots fitted with the S-Type device, seven will show no side effects, two will have moderate to severe memory loss when disconnected from their Wanzer, and the remainder are afflicted with multiple personality disorders, psychosis or in rare instances, brain death. Those who do not survive the procedure are posthumously awarded two ranks.

While far from being the most powerful Wanzer individually, they certainly are such when measured by weight.",,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
# RAVEN,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
daa_raven,SHIP,"The Type-11 Raven is the heaviest 9th generation strike-craft Wanzers in the Diable Avionics catalog, thus the heaviest currently produced period. Being a good 50% larger than 7th gen frames, it can accommodate nearly full-size ship weaponry (minus the ammo storage): a Grave HMG and a compact Glowtusk make those assault Wanzers quite effective against anything but the thickest defense. A compact Grazer Core and huge plates of ablative nano-armor complete the deadly package. 

While designed as a triple-seater craft to help spread the workload, the Raven can still be maned single-handedly by a 9th gen Wanzer pilot thanks to the S-type neural interface. Even with the extra volume and mass of this design, engineers were unable to incorporate both a TX-5 class shield emiter alongside a displacement system, the latter being ultimately kept to prevent outmaneuvering by enemy fighter forces. Mass production of such an advanced craft is not practical and thus comes with an eyebrow-raising price tag.",,,

diableavionics_avalancheHead,WEAPON,A stock Recson firing mechanism adapted to wanzer use by integrating it with the wanzer tracking sensors suite and mounting it in the head. It is rumored the prototype of the Avalanche mounted a full-size unmodified Recson turret in place of the Wanzer's head.,,,
diableavionics_avalancheGun,WEAPON,"The D-64 FLAK ""Snow Ball"" is equally legendary among pilots and all those who found themselves at the wrong end of its barrel. The nickname might refer to the white hot glow of the weapon during heavy use.",,,

diableavionics_blizzaiaHead,WEAPON,"A single IBIS barrel integrated in the top of the head and occupying 70% of its volume. Being designed to follow the pilot's head movements and verbal cues automatically, some hangar arguments are occasionally underscored by the sudden revving sounds of this weapon's firing mechanism.",,,
diableavionics_blizzaiaCicada,WEAPON,"This weapon was allegedly the main responsible for the BLIZZAIA's excellent test performance. Its large blast radius and high burst rate often ensure grenades explode behind enemy shields, inflicting significant hull damage. In prolonged engagements the dampened sound of the cicada's firing mechanism (as conveyed by standard bridge audio simulations) often announces the end of the battle.",,,
diableavionics_blizzaiaGraveac,WEAPON,"An unremarkable integration of a Grave anti-shield cannon, with reduced rate of fire, replacing most of the right arm of the wanzer. Most often used to pressure the opponent into a vulnerable position for heavier weaponry, its reliability is often underestimated.",,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_valianthead,WEAPON,"As the Valiant project was ideated with the expressed goal of exceeding the limits of Wanzer technology, everything had to match up, hence the ILIS PD system provides a frighteningly accurate point defense solution. However, its high energy requirements and sensitive calibration most often result in veteran pilots preferring to use other weaponry or the Valiant's extraordinary maneuvrability to avoid fire, rather than entrusting their lives to an auto-targeting beam.",,,
diableavionics_valiantleftAA,WEAPON,"This weapon's spec sheets are to this day under top secret classification and cannot be discussed in this manual. What is known from pilot reports and battlefield performance alone implies these eletromagnetic rifles surpass all previous implementations of the technology, including the theoretical models devised by Alpha AIs before the war.",,,
diableavionics_valiantrightAA,WEAPON,"Despite the dearth of information on this EM rifle, the very fact two of them comprise the main weaponry of the (current) pinnacle of wanzer technology conveys the level of expectations put upon their performance.",,,

diableavionics_frosthead,WEAPON,"An early implementation of the mono-barrel IBIS variant of PD weaponry. Due to space requirements, the IBIS is de facto redesigned from the ground up to fit the new specifications. However, the difficulty of sourcing components for this variant and its dubious performance resulted in later models adapting stock IBIS turrets for the purpose.",,,
diableavionics_frostLeftArm,WEAPON,"The ""Covet"" is a submachinegun with a rate-of-fire capping mechanism. The common discovery by the more tech-savvy recruits that this limitation can in fact be easily lifted has given raise to the practice known as ""recruit slicing"". This consists of a simulator bout where the unavoidable weapon jam of the recruit's uncapped Covet is met by the instructor's prompt use of his microfilament blade in a disciplinary fashion. A perfect illustration of the Frost's ""less is more"" design philosophy.",,,
diableavionics_frostBlade,WEAPON,"Source of the Frost's popularity with recruits despite the less-than-stellar survival times of this wanzer, this monofilament blade is but a crude adaptation of the cutting devices used in the ship-breaking industry. Compared to similar designs from other manufacturers, it requires nothing less than flawless manual control and cannot be reliably automated. Its range is likewise short, resulting in routine Frost pilot training encompassing many hours of swordsmanship practice, and many a veteran carrying human-sized monofilament blades on their waists in flagrant violation of modern military code. ",,,

diableavionics_strifegun,WEAPON,"The Grom gatling gun is an unremarkable design entirely dedicated to eliminating unarmored, unshielded targets, which nonetheless acquired a reputation due to its flawless reliability profile and its adversaries' tendency to underestimate its presence. The great rate of fire and uncomplicated aiming system ensures even unskilled pilots can make a difference by decimating enemy ordnance on the battlefield and crushing already ""softened"" targets.",,,

diableavionics_warlusthead,WEAPON,"Despite the specification sheet calling for a single-barrel IBIS PD weapon installation, the final model inexplicably includes a full-sized, twin barrel point-defense IBIS in the head casing of the wanzer.

diableavionics_warlustmissile,WEAPON,"The signature magicbox PD missile detonates by proximity fuse, releasing flak sharpnel over remarkable distances, trivializing torpedo and missile threats. As the Warlust mounts this weapon in combination with a well-tuned IBIS, any damage the wanzer suffers from such weaponry can only be attributed to human error.",,,
diableavionics_warlustgun,WEAPON,"Heat-resistant piercing rounds designed to stress shields are the standard ammuniton for this long range rifle. Despite not using a railgun mechanism, multiple explosions in the firing chamber are used in a similar faction to progressively accelerate the projectile to comparable speeds.",,,
,,,,,
diableavionics_ravenhead,WEAPON,"A full-sized Burchell rapid laser. A far cry from the elegant ILIS PD, the Burchell is designed to increase its rate of fire and reach at the cost of component life-time.

diableavionics_hoar_winee,WEAPON,"This unique weapon became the centerpiece of the Hoar project. Capable of inflicting wide-arc EMP and energy damage, its original anti-fighter design evolved in field testing to encompass a myriad of anti-ship, anti-wanzer and cataphract applications. This truly multi-purpose weapon doesn't ultimately excel in any single application, which might be the cause of its conspicuous absence in later designs. Despite this, it's considered a backbone of Wanzer technology by engineers, and enables the Hoar to persist as a mainstay design on the battlefield.",,,
diableavionics_hoarArmL,WEAPON,"As a ""handgun"" design, the AFP-99 tombstone is often jokingly referred to as a death sentence for the pilot relying on it. Its usual function is often nothing more than an improved PD weapon or bait for the hoar's slower, but more decisive Winee.",,,
diableavionics_hoarArmR,WEAPON,"Quite disappointing in its stated anti-hull application, the Tombstone nonetheless provides much-needed firepower, compensating for the high-delay main weaponry of the Hoar.",,,
